### PID algorithm
The PID controller is an algothm used to follow a reference through a closed loop system that calcultes the error from a setpoint and the actual state of the system and set the control input as a proportion of this cross-track error or CTE. The setpoint is the x and y coordinates at the center of the road of the desired trajectory of the car.

In the PID algorithm, the **P** stands for proportional, the **I** for integral and the **D** for differential. Each part of the algorithm plays an important role to control the postion of the car and how it reaches the goal position. The P and D modifies the transient response of the system and the I eliminates the steady state error. These gains do this job through the error of the system. The proportional gain means that the steering angle of the car will be set in proportion of the CTE. The integral part accumulate the CTE up to the current point. The sign of that accumulative error means which side of the road the car has been for a while in. The D parte takes the rate of change of CTE and a high value will result in high overshooting.

The architecture of the controller is:


``steering_angle = P*cte + I*cte_integral + D*cte_differential``

Tunning the gains is not an easy task. A high **I** gain turns into sharp oscilations and the car will roll out of the road. Similarly, finding the right **P** and **D** should be done also carfully to improve the transient response. If the P gain is to high, the car will overcorrect the CTE and improve amplitud of oscilations or if it is to low, it will have a really slow reaction, which is not a good scenario when refering to curves.

The strategy that I followed was, first by hand, I chose gains and saw how the system behaved. The values selected for P, I and D were -0.16, 0.0 and -2.5, respectively. Then, I used Twiddle to fine tune the controller. You can see the code of the Twiddle algorithm at the PID.cpp from line 60 to 109.

The final gains are: 

* Kp = -0.161991
* Ki = -0.000008
* Kd = -2.49979

* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
